🍷 Wine Quality Prediction – Production-Ready ML System

## 🚀 Overview

This project is a production-grade end-to-end Machine Learning system that predicts wine quality using physicochemical attributes.

It demonstrates how to design, train, containerize, and deploy an ML model to the cloud using modern DevOps and MLOps practices.

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Predict wine quality based on chemical properties such as acidity, sugar content, pH, sulphates, and alcohol level.

The objective is to transform raw tabular data into a scalable and deployable ML service.
